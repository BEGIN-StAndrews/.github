## Hi there 👋

# Let's BEGIN a spatial-driven conversation
Spatial data is key to unlocking a deeper understanding of our planet and its intricate systems. This is the public GitHub Organization where you can find the repositories we are working on that are related to our work.

#  Who we are
The Bell Edwards Geographic Data Institute (BEGIN) is a network of data researchers in the School of Geography and Sustainable Development (SGSD) at the University of St Andrews. The institute brings together academic staff, postdoctoral researchers, and PhD students who work with geographic data and are interested in developing new methods and modelling approaches for geographic problems. The network also provides a platform to promote collaboration, teaching, and outreach.
